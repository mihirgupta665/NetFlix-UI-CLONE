# Netflix UI Clone

This project is a responsive Netflix UI clone built using **pure HTML and CSS** as part of my CSS learning journey.  
The goal of this project was to practice layout design, responsiveness, and modern CSS techniques without using JavaScript or any frontend framework.

The application focuses on recreating the visual structure of Netflix’s landing page, including sections, typography, media placement, and responsive behavior across different screen sizes.

This project serves as a **CSS learning closure project** and demonstrates a strong understanding of flexbox, grid, media queries, and UI structuring principles.
